# ðŸ¦€ What is this project?
This is a new personal project I'm working on, a Coupon API for [OldBot](http://oldbot.com.br/)(my other project) where I will validate coupons and license discounts.

The main technologies used are:
    - Rust.
    - Actix Web framework.
    - Tokio as asynchronous runtime.
    - MySQL database.
    - Simple Bearer token authentication.

It has been deployed on Heroku and is live at https://coupon-api-oldbot.herokuapp.com/, since it requires authentication, you won't be able to interact with it. I will work on a demo version of it where others can interact with it in a test database.

In this repository, you can also find the `Coupon API.postman_collection.json` file, which you can import on Postman to have a template for the API calls.
